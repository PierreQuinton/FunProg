# FunProg
This repository contains an introduction to functional programming.
The place to start is the folder `church_encodings` in which there are several Python files as well as two markdown
files:
- `theory.md` provides notes for the course and references for the theory of the course.
- `exercises.md` provide the instructions for the exercises, they are mostly the steps to achieve but the resolution of
  the exercises will probably require reading the theory.
